# simple-status
Very simple status page.

I googled about status page. Most of them are paid service - too much for me; some are opensourced projects - too heavy for me.
This one I'd like it to be simple enough to be only a status page, NOT a monitor page. Ideally, the only thing you need to do is write a JSON config then find a place to host. That's it.

Still under construction now.
